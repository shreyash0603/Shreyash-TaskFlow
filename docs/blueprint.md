## Core Features:

- Task Order Display: Display task execution order based on resolved dependencies.

- DAG Visualization: Visually represent task dependencies and execution flow in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Failure Highlighting: Highlight tasks that have failed or are being retried.
- AI-Powered Deadlock Resolution Suggestions: If execution deadlocks or cycles are detected, leverage AI tool to provide potential resolution strategies by re-evaluating task execution based on resource usage and past execution data. This could include dynamically adjusting task priorities or suggesting alternative execution paths to break deadlocks.
